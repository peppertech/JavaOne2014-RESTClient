JavaOne 2014 REST Client
======================

This is the REST HTML5-JavaScript-CSS client demo'd during the JavaOne 2014 session called:  Coding for Desktop and Mobile with HTML5 and Java EE 7 - CON3143


The client-side code is written to work with a REST service that is built using NetBeans IDE wizards for generating a REST service from an existing Database.  You can reference this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mISEAPKwYa0'>Screencast</a> for details on how to create that REST service. Instead of using the Oracle DB as described in the video, use the JavaDB sample database that comes with NetBeans and select the "Manufacturer" table.
